USB drivers
===========
:compact-option:

_usb-drivers_ is a collection of utilities to control various hardware over USB.

Utility overview
----------------

eizoctl
~~~~~~~
_eizoctl_ controls elementary settings of EIZO computer monitors, which do not
support DDC/CI.  Say no to oily stains on your monitor's frame!

 $ eizoctl --brightness +0.5 --input USB-C

It is intended as a replacement for official EIZO software,
and may not run at the same time, as it would contend for device access.

eizoctltray
~~~~~~~~~~~
_eizoctltray_ is a derived Windows/macOS utility that can stay in the systray.
When holding the Shift or Control keys while switching signal inputs,
it will also suspend or power off the system, respectively.

elksmart-comm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
_elksmart-comm_ interfaces with ELK Smart infrared dongles EKX4S and EKX5S-T,
partially reimplementing the Ocrustar mobile app.  It can both receive and send,
although the older dongle is extremely unreliable at receiving.

To mimic the Nikon ML-L3 infrared wireless remote control:

 $ elksmart-comm 80ffffffffffffc71c5f1bda1bffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff3a7bffffffffffff99185f1bda1b03

While it does not build for Windows, this is incidental.

razer-bw-te-ctl
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
_razer-bw-te-ctl_ makes it possible to change the configuration of your Razer
BlackWidow Tournament Edition keybooard (the 2012 model).

Make sure to let the Windows Razer Synapse tool upgrade the firmware to the
newest version before running the program.  There might be some issues otherwise
due to protocol changes, although I don't really deem it very probable.

Packages
--------
Regular releases are sporadic.  git master should be stable enough.
You can get a package with the latest development version
as a https://git.janouch.name/p/nixexprs[Nix derivation].

Windows binaries can be downloaded from
https://git.janouch.name/p/usb-drivers/releases[the Releases page on Gitea].

Building
--------
Build dependencies:
 CMake, pkg-config, liberty (included) +
Runtime dependencies:
 libusb-1.0 (elksmart-comm, razer-bw-te-ctl), hidapi >= 0.14 (eizoctl)

 $ git clone --recursive https://git.janouch.name/p/usb-drivers.git
 $ mkdir usb-drivers/build
 $ cd usb-drivers/build
 $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
 $ make

To install the applications, you can do either the usual:

 # make install

Or you can try telling CMake to make a package for you.  For Debian it is:

 $ cpack -G DEB
 # dpkg -i usb-drivers-*.deb

Windows
~~~~~~~
You can either build within an MSYS2 environment,
or cross-compile using Mingw-w64:

 $ sh -e cmake/Win64Depends.sh
 $ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=liberty/cmake/toolchains/MinGW-w64-x64.cmake \
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B build
 $ cmake --build build

macOS
~~~~~
You can either build _eizoctltray_ against Homebrew,
or link hidapi statically for a standalone portable app:

 $ git clone https://github.com/libusb/hidapi.git
 $ cmake -S hidapi -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF \
   -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/hidapi-build \
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B hidapi-build
 $ cmake --build hidapi-build -- install
 $ cmake -Dhidapi_ROOT=$PWD/hidapi-build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B build
 $ cmake --build build
